## Render and Streamlit
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

"Fictional Scenario: We are building a platform for a purchaser who resells cars to monster truck shows and limousine dealerships. They need information on vehicle pricing, color and drivetrain in order to create a marketing plan for their inventory.

To define the client needs,

A typical vehicle for a limousine is a monochrome two-wheel drive vehicle, or a monochrome 4x4 vehicle.
A typical vehicle for a monster truck is a color 4x4 vehicle.
A third variation is a monster limo - a monochrome 4x4 vehicle.

Users on the web platform/app need to be able to 

1) Learn about pricing for vehicles
2) Filter via checkbox for more information"

FILES: 

README.md - Project information
app.py - Python file containing code for app and visual charting
EDA.ipynb - Exploratory Data Analysis of Dataset 'vehicles_us.csv'
requirements.txt - Listing of packages required for app deployment
vehicles_us.csv - Dataset used for EDA.ipynb analysis

SERVICES:
Streamlit for Visualization
Render for App Deployment

PROJECT RUBRIC/REQUIREMENTS (APP)
Created a visual with a:
    1) Scatterplot comparing odometer readings and price
    2) Checkbox option to show a histogram plot showing price for all vehicles

For reviewer:
Render deploys the package successfully but it does not launch.
Streamlit loads locally but not on the web.  
The app could be expanded after it loads succesfully.
