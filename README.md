## Render and Streamlit

Created a visual with a:
    1) Scatterplot comparing odometer readings and price
    2) Checkbox option to show a histogram plot showing price for all vehicles

For reviewer:
Render deploys the package successfully but it does not launch.
Streamlit loads locally but not on the web.  
The app could be expanded after it loads succesfully.
